The goal of this project is to detect RFID card agents in real time.

To achieve this, I developed a solution leveraging the ESP8266 microcontroller and RFID modules to read RFID tags. The collected data is transmitted seamlessly via the MQTT protocol for efficient and reliable communication.

For further processing and analysis, the data is ingested into a Python-based ETL pipeline, where it undergoes extraction, transformation, and loading to enable actionable insights and real-time decision-making.
